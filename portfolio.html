The game has a fantasy theme with just a touch of steampunk. He and his team wanted a fullscreen design with multiple pages.</p><br><h2>Technologies Used</h2><hr align='left'><ul><li>HTML/CSS</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Bootstrap</li><li>jQuery</li><li>Microsoft Azure</li><li>Adobe Photoshop CC</li><li>Balsamiq Mockups 3</li></ul><br><h2>Process</h2><hr align='left'><p>This was the first site I designed without the use of a CMS (e.g. Wordpress). I started by mocking up the layout using Balsamiq Mockups, a wireframing program, and sent them to the team for approval. The team also provided me with a good selection of concept art and in-game models, but I still had to do quite a bit of Photoshop work to fit them to my needs. The team ended up being quite satisfied with my work, citing that I did a good job in capturing the fantasy/steampunk aesthetic.</p><br><h2>Noteworthy</h2><hr align='left'><p>I am especailly proud of the &quot;Commander Select&quot; boxes in the middle of the homepage. I had to write everything in jQuery from scratch, and it was difficult to get the timing down so that the background image did not flicker when a new commander was being selected. I was also very happy with how the Game Narrative page came out. In order to create a &quot;storybook&quot; effect, I had to create a render from the concept art that was provided to me and use a radial mask.</p>">

The company's flagship product had just undergone major changes, and the appearance was very dated. My job was to update the look and feel of promotional materials for both the site and in-print promotional materials. Even though I left in 2013, my materials are still being used. The only guideline for this project was that the &quot;Vizman&quot; mascot had to be prominently featured.</p><br><h2>Technologies Used</h2><hr align='left'><ul><li>Adobe Photoshop CC</li><li>TBS Cover Editor 2.0</li></ul><br><h2>Process</h2><hr align='left'><p>For this project, I tried to achieve a somewhat minimalist design that utilized various shades of blue. The intended effect was to draw attention to the logo before the other elements. After I had the primary design complete, I added the other elements and created a front, side, and CD view. With TBS Cover Editor, I was able to render those together into one 3D model.</p>">

I drew up the design for the inner circle in Illustrator and placed it on top of a photo of a sunset in Photoshop. From there, I put a gradient burn in the background and reduced the saturation. In order to draw attention to the logo, I canceled out the effect inside of the circle so that it contrasted with the rest of the image.</p><br><h2>Noteworthy</h2><hr align='left'><p>I got an amazing response to this design that I was not expecting. About 85% of the chapter used this as their profile picture on Facebook. Not long after, chapters from all over the West Coast were setting my design as their profile picture. One chapter even asked me if they could use my design on a t-shirt.</p>">

The most challenging part of this design was creating the foreground in Adobe Illustrator, especially the man holding the glass, which required quite a bit of Live Tracing from a low-res picture.</p><br><h2>Noteworthy</h2><hr align='left'><p>This design also got good reception from the Chapter. One of the brothers even painted the design on the fence of our Chapter house.</p>">

The service met our needs but, they charged a heavy premium. In the interest of saving money, the Chapter President hired a photographer and asked if I wanted to design it. I enthusiastically accepted the challenge. The only stipulation was that it had to look similar to the composites throughout the Chapter's history (i.e. &quot;plain&quot;).</p><br><h2>Technologies Used</h2><hr align='left'><ul><li>Adobe Photoshop CC</li></ul><br><h2>Process</h2><hr align='left'><p>This image had to be very large, as it would be blown up to three feet tall by four feet wide, framed, and hung on the wall in our Chapter house. The problem was that we did not have an image of our fraternity's crest that was large enough to suit an image that size. I had to contact the fraternity's Executive Office to obtain a vectorized SVG. Once that was in place, the next and most difficult challenge was to plan out the number of photos in each row so that the layout looked even. In the end, I was able to create a professional-looking composite that will be on the wall of the Chapter house for decades to come.</p>">

The class had an ongoing project throughout the entirety of the course where we worked with groups to come up with business plans for any venture the group decided on. Our group's venture was GoGreenGym (AKA G3): a fitness center where using the equipment would generate energy, which, in turn, would power the facility. There was also an emphasis on automated workout tracking and gamification. We got very high marks for this assignment.<br><br>For this project, we had to assign &quot;C&quot;-level positions to each member of the group. I volunteered to be the CMO, responsible for all things visual, as well as ad copy.</p><br><h2>Technologies Used</h2><hr align='left'><ul><li>Adobe Photoshop CC</li><li>Plasq Skitch</li></ul><br><h2>Process</h2><hr align='left'><p>Since this was a very new-age and &quot;green&quot; idea, I wanted the logo to feel high-energy, clean, and modern. I was able to capture that with thin text, bright green colors, and basic shapes that formed a lightning bolt.<br><br>When I took this class in 2012 Skeumorphism was the prevailing design theory for Mobile. Thus, brushed metal and a carbon fiber navigation bar would have been appropriate at the time. If I were to redesign this so that it fits current best practices, I would adopt a &quot;Flat&quot; layout with solid colors as opposed to textures.</p>">
